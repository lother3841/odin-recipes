# Odin Recipes

## Introduction
This project, **Odin Recipes**, is my first HTML-based website, created as part of The Odin Project curriculum. The purpose of this project is to build a basic website structure using HTML, demonstrating my skills in creating, linking, and organizing web pages.

## Project Overview
The website is a simple recipe collection featuring multiple recipe pages, each containing the following elements:
- Structured HTML content with headings, images, descriptions, and lists.
- Links to navigate between an index page and individual recipe pages.
- Use of ordered and unordered lists for clear ingredient and step-by-step instructions.

## Skills Demonstrated
By completing this project, I will have demonstrated:
- Proficiency in setting up an HTML boilerplate for multiple pages.
- Ability to organize a multi-page website structure and link pages effectively.
- Use of semantic HTML tags and elements to structure content in a readable and organized way.
- Basic file organization within a web project, including linking to images and directories.

## Reflection

("Building the webpage was straightforwardâ€”I created the file structure through the command prompt and coded everything relatively quickly. 
This project was helpful practice for using Git, particularly with adding, committing, and pushing changes to the origin,
 as well as cloning and updating repositories. Overall, it was good hands-on experience with version control while building a basic website.")
