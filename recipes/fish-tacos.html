    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
        Fish tacos are a fresh, flavorful take on traditional tacos, combining crispy, seasoned fish with vibrant toppings.<br> 
        The fish, typically a white, flaky variety like cod or tilapia, is seasoned with a blend of spices and pan-fried or grilled to perfection.<br>
        Once cooked, the fish is placed in warm tortillas and topped with a colorful assortment of fresh ingredients, such as shredded cabbage,<br> 
        sliced radishes, and a squeeze of lime. These toppings add a refreshing crunch and brightness, perfectly balancing the rich, savory flavor of the fish.<br>

    <p>
      A creamy, tangy sauce often complements fish tacos, made from ingredients like mayonnaise, sour cream, and lime juice, with a touch of hot sauce for a hint of spice.<br> 
      This sauce ties all the flavors together, coating each bite in a smooth, zesty finish. Fish tacos are a versatile dish, easily customizable with toppings like avocado slices,<br> 
      cilantro, or pico de gallo, making them a popular, crowd-pleasing option for a light, satisfying meal.<br>
