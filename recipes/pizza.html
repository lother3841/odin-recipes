    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
        Pizza is a beloved classic that brings together a perfect balance of flavors and textures, starting with a warm, crispy crust as its base.<br> 
        The dough, typically made from flour, yeast, water, and a touch of olive oil, is kneaded and left to rise before being stretched into a thin,<br> 
        even layer. Once prepared, a layer of rich tomato sauce is spread across the crust, providing a tangy, savory foundation.<br>
        Fresh or shredded mozzarella cheese is generously sprinkled over the sauce, melting into a gooey, golden topping as it bakes.<br>
    </p>

    <p>
        Toppings can vary widely based on taste, ranging from traditional options like pepperoni and mushrooms to fresh vegetables, olives, and even pineapple for a sweet twist.<br>
         The pizza is then baked in a hot oven, allowing the crust to crisp up while the cheese melts and toppings cook to perfection.<br> 
         The result is a deliciously satisfying dish with a balance of crispy, chewy, and savory elements that appeal to just about any palate.<br> 
         Whether enjoyed as a simple Margherita or loaded with toppings, homemade pizza brings warmth and comfort to the table every time.<br>

    <h3><strong>Ingredients</strong></h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups all-purpose flour (for the crust)</li>
        <li>1 cup warm water</li>
        <li>1 packet active dry yeast</li>
        <li>1 cup tomato sauce</li>
        <li>1 ½ cups shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
        <li>Fresh basil leaves (for garnish)</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3><strong>Steps</strong></h3>
    <ol>
       <li><b>Prepare the Dough</b>In a mixing bowl, dissolve the yeast in warm water and let it sit<br>
            for about 5 minutes, until it becomes foamy. Gradually add flour and a pinch of salt,<br>
            mixing until a dough forms. Knead the dough on a floured surface for 5-7 minutes,<br> 
            until smooth and elastic.<br>
        </li>
       
        <li><b>Let the Dough Rise:</b>Place the dough in a lightly oiled bowl, cover it with a cloth, <br>
            and let it rise in a warm place for 1-1.5 hours, or until it doubles in size.
        </li>
        <li><b>Preheat the Oven:</b>Preheat your oven to 475°F (245°C). If you have a pizza stone,<br> 
            place it in the oven to heat up as well.
        </li>
        <li><b>Shape the Dough:</b>Once risen, punch down the dough and roll or stretch it into <br>
            thin, even circle or rectangle on a lightly floured surface. Transfer it to a baking sheet<br> 
            or preheated pizza stone.<br>
        </li>
        <li><b>Add Toppings:</b>Spread a layer of tomato sauce evenly over the dough, leaving a<br> 
            small border for the crust. Sprinkle shredded mozzarella cheese on top, and add<br> 
            fresh basil leaves or any other desired toppings.
        </li>
        <li><b>Bake the Pizza:</b>Place the pizza in the preheated oven and bake for 10-12 minutes,<br>
             or until the crust is golden and the cheese is melted and bubbly.
        </li>
        <li><b>Serve:</b>Remove the pizza from the oven, let it cool slightly, then slice and enjoy!
        </li>
    </ol>
