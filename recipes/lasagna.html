    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
        Lasagna is a classic Italian dish that layers rich flavors and textures, making it a beloved favorite at family gatherings and dinner parties.<br>
        To create the perfect lasagna, start by preparing a hearty meat sauce using ground beef or turkey, simmered with onions, garlic, and crushed tomatoes,<br>
        infused with herbs like basil and oregano. Meanwhile, cook lasagna noodles until they are al dente, ensuring they will hold up well when baked. For a creamy touch,<br>
        blend ricotta cheese with an egg, grated Parmesan, and a sprinkle of nutmeg to create a luscious filling that complements the savory meat sauce.<br>
    </p>

    <p>
        Assembling the lasagna is a delightful process. Begin with a layer of meat sauce at the bottom of a baking dish, followed by a layer of noodles, then spread the ricotta mixture on top,<br>
        and sprinkle with shredded mozzarella. Repeat the layers until you run out of ingredients, finishing with a generous layer of mozzarella and a dusting of Parmesan for a golden, bubbly top.<br>
        Bake in a preheated oven until the cheese is melted and bubbly, and the edges are slightly crispy. Allow the lasagna to rest for a few minutes before slicing; this helps the layers hold together.<br>
        Serve with a fresh salad and crusty bread for a comforting meal that will satisfy any crowd.<br>
